# Diabetes-Prediction-SVM
# Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters. The prediction model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Diabetes dataset, which is available in the `diabetes.csv` file. The dataset contains the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Project Structure

- `Diabetes_Prediction_SVM.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project code.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
